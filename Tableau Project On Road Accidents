This Tableau project analyzes road accident data to uncover patterns and insights that can help improve road safety. It includes interactive dashboards showcasing accident trends by time, location, vehicle type, and weather conditions. Key visualizations highlight high-risk zones, peak accident hours, and demographic impacts. Filters allow users to explore data by region, severity, and contributing factors such as speeding or alcohol use. The project aims to support decision-makers in identifying critical issues and deploying effective safety measures. By transforming raw data into actionable insights, the project promotes data-driven strategies to reduce road accidents and enhance public safety.
